## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting sales by analyzing the impact of advertising budgets allocated to TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The goal is to build a forecasting model using linear regression and assess its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Advertising Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bumba5341/advertisingcsv). It contains data on advertising budgets and corresponding sales.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves tasks like handling duplicate entries and checking for missing values.

## Outlier Analysis

Outlier analysis is conducted to identify and understand potential outliers in the data. Box plots are used to visualize the distribution of the advertising budgets and sales.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization helps understand the relationships between advertising budgets (TV, Radio, and Newspaper) and sales. Scatter plots and heatmaps are used to visualize these relationships.

## Building the Forecasting Model

The project utilizes linear regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to build the forecasting model. Features include advertising budgets, and the target variable is sales.

## Learn the Model

The model is trained using the training dataset to learn the relationship between advertising budgets and sales.

## Predicting Sales

The trained model is used to predict sales based on new data points.

## Testing the Model

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Coefficient of Determination (R-squared).

### Metrics

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. A lower MSE indicates a better fit.
- **Coefficient of Determination (R-squared):** Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
